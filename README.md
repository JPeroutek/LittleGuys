# The Little Guys
The Little Guys is a re-imagining of an old Clay Soldiers mod from the minecraft beta days.  This mod allows you to construct 17 different colors of little guys, and pit them in battle against each other.

You can also construct a Little Horse for them to ride around on.

Little Guys are deployable via right-clicking with the LittleGuy item, or via dispenser.
